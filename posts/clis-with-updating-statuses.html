<h1>CLIs with updating statuses</h1>

<p><i>Different methods for updating statuses inside a CLI</i></p>

<p>I still often prefer Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) over GUIs. I will
distinguish between a CLI and a Textual User Interface (TUI). A true CLI takes
all of its input as command-line arguments and possibly <code>stdin</code>. But if it does
read from <code>stdin</code>, that input should be interpreted as a single block, rather
than as responses to <code>stdout</code>/<code>stderr</code>. CLIs are stateless, as opposed to TUIs
and GUIs that interpret input depending on their state at the time input is
received. You can copy/paste a command-line and get (mostly) the same behavior,
without having to memorize which elements of the GUI to click on.</p>
<p>Traditionally, diagnostic information, like progress updates, are written to
<code>stderr</code>. Actual results are written to <code>stdout</code>. The diagnostics of the
simplest CLIs consist of purely visible characters, which present a tradeoff:
With what frequency should progress updates be written? Infrequent updates
force the user to wait. Frequent updates create a wall of unimportant messages
that potentially obscure more important warnings and errors.</p>
<p>I prefer CLIs that continuously update their status. The way to implement such
updates is rather interesting.  Proper TUIs accomplish status updates by
maintaining a buffer and synchronizing the terminal display to this buffer, but
doing so conflicts with the terminal's scrollback. You can't have status
updates in the right place as the user is scrolling back. Terminal APIs allow
you to write to particular locations on screen, but you can't read what was
previously in those locations. You can't detect scrolling. You can't write to
particular locations within the scrollback buffer.</p>
<p>The mechanism for CLIs with updating statuses dates back at least 150 years to
the first commercially successful typewriter - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter">Sholes and Glidden
typewriter</a> -
which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">carriage return</a>
lever to move the carriage back to the left side of the paper after typing a
line of text. Moving to the left without moving down was used to write text
on-top of existing text, allowing for special effects like strikethrough,
underline, or bold. When carriage return was adapted to teletype machines it
replaced existing characters rather than writing on-top of them, and this
behavior carries forward to TTY terminals (and emulators) today.</p>
<p>This carriage-return replacement forms the basis for CLIs to provide updating
statuses, but these days it's slightly easier with ANSI escape codes. With
carriage-returns you need to print spaces to erase each previously printed
character. If you don't know how many characters were previously printed you
can query the terminal size with the ioctl TIOCGWINSZ, take the width, and then
print that many spaces. With ANSI escape codes you can just print "\033[2K" to
clear the entire line. To clear multiple lines you can repeatedly move the
cursor up with "\033[F" and then clear each line.</p>
<p>A common problem when implementing updating statuses is you don't know if
something else has written to the terminal since you last updated the status.
If you blindly attempt to erase the last status you may instead erase an
important error/warning written to the console. It'd be quite convenient if you
could query the characters in the terminal, but unfortunately this isn't
possible (as far as I can tell). TUI-style libraries, such as curses, emulate this
by maintaining a buffer of the desired terminal contents and repeatedly
synchronizing it to the actual terminal.</p>
<p>I reason that the inability to query a character at a particular position is
the textual equivalent of the GPU readback problem. In the graphics world,
attempting to read a pixel output from the GPU requires waiting for the GPU
pipeline to flush, which introduces high latency. In the text world, your terminal
might be on a different computer, so reading a character at a particular
position would require a network roundtrip.</p>
<p>It's quite interesting that you can successfully read the terminal size. This
doesn't require a network roundtrip because whenever the size of the terminal
changes the ssh client detects the change via SIGWINCH and then forwards it to
the sshd server which communicates it to the kernel with TIOCSWINSZ. This
works, but imperfectly. You may write characters to the terminal before you
find out that the terminal size has just changed. Usually this lack of true
synchronization creates some minor artifacts - maybe the status is displayed
incorrectly until the server receives the window size update and issues a new
status update.</p>
<p>Could similar tricks be played to keep the server informed about the contents
of the entire scrollback buffer? It'd be far more complex - maybe to the point
of being impractical. The sshd server would need to understand <em>exactly</em> how
the terminal interpreted each escape code.</p>
<p>In the absence of readback, how can you ensure that nothing else writes to the
terminal in between status updates? In some sense, this is truly impossible.
Your program may have been invoked from within another program that is also
writing to the terminal simultaneously. But this is arguably a bug in the
calling program, so we'll set this aside.</p>
<p>In small scripts you can carefully avoid writing to the terminal. In larger
scripts you can redirect output to prevent accidentally writing to the
terminal. With a language like Python you can temporarily set
<code>sys.stdout</code>/<code>sys.stderr</code> to different objects satisfying the TextIO interface.
This will catch most accidental writes, but it's still possible to write to
<code>stdout</code>/<code>stderr</code> directly with file descriptors 1/2. A more complete
redirection is possible at the file descriptor level with <code>dup2</code>. File
descriptors are handles, so they operate much like pointers. Conceptually
<code>dup2</code> allows you to "dereference" the file descriptor and "point" it somewhere
else.</p>
<p>These mechanisms mostly work, but expose edge cases and require careful coding
to avoid nasty bugs. If you have some code that expects <code>stderr</code> to be connected
to a TTY it may cause issues when you temporarily redirect <code>stderr</code>.  And if
you don't properly restore <code>stderr</code> you won't be able to see the traceback
normally printed when your program crashes. This is a nasty bug because you may
not even realize there is a problem. </p>
<p>I think the best solution is to consolidate status updates to a tiny process
that parses output from other processes. If those other processes wish to issue
status updates, they can use a special line prefix. This approach means other
processes see <code>stdout</code>/<code>stderr</code> as being disconnected from a terminal, but I'd
argue this is preferable since the root issue stems from multiple programs
attempting to interact with a terminal simultaneously.</p>
